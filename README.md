# Coding Bootcamp Week One Challenge

## Description

This coding challenge required us to refactor the existing code for the Horiseon web0site in order to make it more accessible for its clients and so that it optomized for search engines.

The Acceptance Criteria for this Challenge were broken up into the following parts:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards-

1) WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

2) WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements. THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

3) WHEN I view the icon and image elements
